I ran the k3s-ansible repo against my proxmox successfully after multiple stops / starts.

I wanted to add rancher.  I realized there was another repo/script that installed rke2 
via script and that did install rancher.  (i.e. rke2.sh) 

I pulled the rancher install steps out of rke2.sh and created a script called (remarkably): 
install_rancher.sh
